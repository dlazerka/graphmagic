This file describes how to build package from the sources.

1. Ensure that you have installed the Maven tool (http://apache.maven.org). Proved working with version 2.0.7 and 2.2.1.

2. Execute "mvn package assembly:assembly" command here. Wait until it builds (it may take a few minutes first time).

Now you can find project package in the "target" directory.
