* Show pseudo-edges.
* More than one window with a graph.
* Selecting multiple vertices.
* Renumbering of vertices (by hand, randomly)
* Marking (weighing) edges
* Changing properties of the graph (digraph, multigraph, pseudograph)
* Zooming
* History of graph view actions for the Undo/Redo.
* Export/Import a graph to a file.
* Printing graph
* Localization

Bugs:
* While constructing a new edge we can hover an edge, then leave it unhovered,
  release button, but an edge is still created.
* When popup over an edge is disappeared, the edge becomes hovered forever. 

Improvements:
* Loading plugins from *.class.
* Loading C/C++ plugins using JNI.
